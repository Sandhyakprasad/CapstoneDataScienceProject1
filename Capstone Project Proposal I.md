# **Mortgage Delinquencies and Crime Rates : Capstone Project Proposal 1**

## **Introduction**


To quantify the effect of crime rates on rates of default of residential mortgages.To study and find how crimes rates influence mortgage delinquencies and defaults. Does the crime rates matter and do they have dynamic adverse effects on delinquencies? 

***


## **Purpose**


Build a model to predict mortgage defaults and whether crime rates have an effect on the loan defaults of mortgage holders. Regression analysis is used to analyze default rates over a large sample of residential mortgages for all US states during 2015 . Does crime, possibly act as a proxy for lower property values thereby increasing the probability of loan defaults .This analysis will unfold the the risk factors of loan defaults as the crime rates of neighborhood varies.

## **Approach**

 - **Gather Data:** Gather necessary information needed to perform the study from the above mentioned data resources.
 

 - **Data Wrangling:** Use Python to process the raw data to a tidy dataset. Wrangle out useful information from the                          datasets.
 

 - **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Create summaries of the data. Handle the missing data. Generate exploratory plots to                                   get a better understanding of the data and explore relationships.
 

 - **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct hypothesis testing and find the measures of uncertainity.
 

 - **Machine Learning:** Apply machine learning techniques to answer the question and perform analysis and predict the                          results using the prediction models.
 

 - **Data Story Telling:** Interpret ,inform and influence the audience with the results of the data analysis.
